# Banich Lab ABCD Repository 

The ABCD study is a large, long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. The study involves over 11,000 children and aims to understand how various factors, including genetics, environment, and behavior, impact brain development during adolescence.

This repository is dedicated to the storage and sharing of code related to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from the Banich Lab. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for all code related to ABCD analyses, making it easier for members of the research team to collaborate and build upon each other's work.

By sharing code in this repository, we hope to increase transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration within the ABCD research community. All code shared in this repository is open source and available for use and modification by others in the research community.

We encourage all members of the Banich Lab to contribute to this repository by uploading their code, documentation, and any other relevant materials. If you have questions or suggestions for this repository, please reach out to the repository maintainers.

Let's work together to advance our understanding of adolescent brain development!
