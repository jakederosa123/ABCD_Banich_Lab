# Scripts

The purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized location for all code related to ABCD analyses, making it easier for members of the lab to collaborate and build upon each other's work. All code shared in this directory should be related to ABCD studies and should be well documented to ensure maximum transparency and reproducibility.

It is important that all code uploaded to this directory is thoroughly documented. This includes, but is not limited to, clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of the code, descriptions of inputs and outputs, and any relevant notes or comments.

All members of the Banich lab are encouraged to contribute to this directory by uploading their code, documentation, and any other relevant materials. If you have questions or suggestions for this directory, please reach out to the repository maintainers.
